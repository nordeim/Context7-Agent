awesome job! but I believe you can create an even more awesomely cool looking and user-friendly interactive CLI agent that interacts with the Context7 MCP server to search for relevant document for a given subject. please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and systematically explore carefully and thoroughly to re-image a re-imagined app. Please try your very best! I have tremendous faith in your super app coding ability. thank you and good luck!

Deeply understand your role and responsibilities and share with me your understanding.

Then help me to carefully review and validate the application codebase shared in the `project_codebase_files_set.md` attached. All the files in the current project codebase are listed in the `currect_project_file_structure.txt` attached, meaning if you want to look for a file and it is not in this list, then treat it as non-existent. Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase, then create for me a detailed architecture overview document in markdown and named `Project Architecture Overview Document.md`. Make sure you do a careful review and validation of the application codebase shared. Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase. Use at least 6000 words for the document that accurately describes the codebase in detail, use a clear diagram to show the codebase relationship. Include a section to describe the file structure and the purpose of each folder and key files, start with a diagram.

Please carefully validate any logic and coding errors that you may suspect, then use extensive web searches to validate your findings and assumptions.
