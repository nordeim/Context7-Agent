The import error comes from referring to a module path that no longer exists in the latest Pydantic AI release. The user is trying to pull in an OpenAI provider class via “pydantic_ai.llm.openai”, but examining the repository structure shows that all model‐provider code now lives under the “pydantic_ai.models” package. The “llm” subpackage was removed in favor of a unified “models” folder.

To fix this, we need to point our import at the correct path. We’ll verify by exploring the installed package (e.g., pip show pydantic-ai, then inspect site-packages/pydantic_ai/models/openai.py) to confirm the class name, which is indeed “OpenAI”. Then we simply change:

    from pydantic_ai.llm.openai import OpenAI

to:

    from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAI

After patching, rerun the CLI to make sure the ModuleNotFoundError goes away. If any further MCP import errors surface, we’ll repeat the same lookup to align import paths with the installed layout.

# Solution

Below is an execution plan followed by the minimal code patch.

## Execution Plan

1. Inspect your environment’s Pydantic AI install:
   - Locate `site-packages/pydantic_ai/models/openai.py` to verify the class name.
2. Update the import statement in **`src/agent.py`**.
3. Rerun the CLI tool:
   ```bash
   python3 src/cli.py
   ```
4. Confirm there are no more `ModuleNotFoundError` messages.

## Patch: Update `src/agent.py`

```diff
--- a/src/agent.py
+++ b/src/agent.py
@@
-from pydantic_ai.llm.openai import OpenAI as OpenAI_LLM
+from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAI as OpenAI_LLM
```

With this change, the runtime will load the OpenAI provider from the correct module path. If you encounter similar errors with other imports (e.g., the MCP client), repeat these steps: locate the actual package layout under `site-packages` and adjust your import to match.
