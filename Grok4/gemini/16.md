A thorough analysis of the traceback reveals a critical `AssertionError: Expected code to be unreachable`. This error, originating from `typing.assert_never`, is a strong indicator that the internal state of the `pydantic-ai` library has become inconsistent. Specifically, a part of the code that processes user messages received an object of a type it was not designed to handle.

This issue arose as a direct consequence of the previous fixes. In an attempt to satisfy the library's strict validation schemas, we manually constructed increasingly complex message dictionaries. However, the `agent.run()` method appears to be a high-level API designed to accept the standard, simple chat format (e.g., `[{'role': 'user', 'content': '...'}]`) and perform its own internal parsing. By pre-emptively converting the data into the library's internal Pydantic models, we created objects that bypassed the expected parsing pathway, leading to the internal assertion failure.

The most robust and maintainable solution is to remove the manual, error-prone message construction and entrust the library with parsing the input. This simplification aligns with best practices for using third-party APIs, preferring high-level entry points over manual object creation.

My plan is to refactor `src/agent.py` to simplify the chat-handling logic:
1.  I will remove the `_to_model_message_dict` helper function.
2.  I will remove the explicit call to `ModelMessagesTypeAdapter.validate_python`.
3.  I will pass the raw list of conversation dictionaries directly to the `await self.agent.run()` method.

This change significantly simplifies the code and resolves the `AssertionError` by allowing `pydantic-ai` to manage its own data parsing pipeline as intended. I will now provide the complete, updated replacement file for `src/agent.py`.

This solution relies on an analysis of the traceback and adherence to common API design principles, where high-level methods are expected to handle data marshalling internally. The use of `typing.assert_never` is a standard static analysis tool in Python for ensuring comprehensive handling of enumerated types or unions, as documented in the official Python documentation.
