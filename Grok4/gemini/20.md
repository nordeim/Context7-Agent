I have conducted a comprehensive re-evaluation of the entire error history. The persistent `AssertionError` deep within the `pydantic-ai` library, regardless of whether the input is a dictionary or a manually constructed Pydantic model, points to a fundamental misuse of the `agent.run` method.

A meticulous review of the traceback provides the crucial clue: `async for _ in agent_run:`. This line from the library's source code reveals that `agent.run` returns an **asynchronous generator**, not a simple awaitable coroutine. An async generator is designed to be iterated over (e.g., to handle streaming responses), and directly awaiting it is incorrect. My previous code, `ai_response = await self.agent.run(...)`, was the source of this subtle but critical bug. While it didn't raise a `TypeError: 'async_generator' object is not awaitable`, it appears to have caused the generator to be passed incorrectly through the library's internal call stack, leading to the `AssertionError`.

The correct approach is to consume the async generator properly. The final response from the agent is typically the last value yielded by this generator.

Furthermore, this insight simplifies the input problem. A high-level API like `agent.run` is most likely designed to accept the simplest, most common data format for chat histories: a standard list of `{'role': ..., 'content': ...}` dictionaries. The library should be responsible for its own internal parsing and model creation. My previous attempts to manually create the models were an over-correction that introduced new problems.

My definitive plan is to correct both of these issues in `src/agent.py`:

1.  **Revert to Simple Input**: I will remove the Pydantic model creation (`_to_pydantic_models` helper and associated imports) and pass the raw list of dictionaries directly to the agent.
2.  **Correctly Consume the Generator**: I will modify the call site to iterate through the async generator returned by `agent.run` and capture the last yielded value as the final response.

This two-pronged fix corrects my incorrect usage of the `agent.run` method and simplifies the code to align with the library's intended high-level API. This is the most robust and architecturally sound solution.

I will now provide the complete, updated replacement file for `src/agent.py`.

This solution is based on a deep analysis of the library's behavior as indicated by the traceback, combined with the standard Python idiom for handling asynchronous generators. The documentation for `asyncio` and general Python asynchronous programming guides confirm that an `async for` loop is the correct way to consume an async generator.
