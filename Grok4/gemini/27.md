I have conducted a final, exhaustive re-evaluation of the entire error history. The persistent `AssertionError` from deep within the `pydantic-ai` library's internal graph processing, regardless of the input format (raw dictionaries, high-level `ModelRequest` objects, or low-level `*Part` objects), points to a fundamental and intractable issue with the `agent.run()` method in the installed version of the library. This suggests a subtle version incompatibility or a bug that cannot be resolved by further altering the input.

The most robust and pragmatic engineering solution is to bypass the problematic `agent.run()` method for the standard chat functionality and use the underlying OpenAI client directly, a pattern that is already successfully used in the "search" branch of the same function. The `pydantic-ai` `OpenAIProvider` conveniently exposes both synchronous and asynchronous OpenAI clients. To maintain the application's asynchronous integrity, I will use the async client.

My definitive plan is to refactor `src/agent.py` to implement this bypass:

1.  **Remove Unused Code**: The `_to_message_parts` helper function and its associated imports from `pydantic_ai.messages` are now obsolete and will be removed to simplify the code.
2.  **Refactor Chat Logic**: In the `generate_response` method, the `else` block for handling standard chat will be rewritten. Instead of calling `agent.run()`, it will now call `await self.llm.provider.async_client.chat.completions.create()`.
3.  **Use Raw Messages**: This direct client call will use the simple `conversation + [{"role": "user", "content": message}]` list of dictionaries, which is the standard format for the OpenAI API and is already proven to work elsewhere in the application.

This surgical change circumvents the faulty component, leverages a known-working pattern from within the same file, fixes the crash, and preserves the application's asynchronous architecture.

I will now provide the complete, updated replacement file for `src/agent.py`.

This solution is based on a pragmatic software engineering principle: when a component or abstraction is consistently failing in unrecoverable ways, it is often best to work around it by using a lower-level, more stable dependency that it wraps. The existence and functionality of the underlying OpenAI client were confirmed by its successful use in another part of the same file.
