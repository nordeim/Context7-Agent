### Error Analysis
The `TypeError` has shifted: `OpenAIModel.__init__()` does not accept `temperature` or `max_tokens` as keyword arguments. These are generation parameters (controlling creativity and response length) that belong in the API call (e.g., during chat or generation), not the model constructor. `OpenAIModel` likely only expects the model name (positional) and `provider`, based on the code comment and error.

### Fix
Modify `src/agent.py` to remove `temperature` and `max_tokens` from `OpenAIModel` init. Instead, pass them to the `stream_chat` method if the `pydantic_ai` library supports it (check its docs or source for `Agent.stream_chat` signature). If not, you may need to override or extend the Agent class to include these params in the underlying OpenAI API call.

Updated `_build_llm`:

```python
def _build_llm() -> OpenAIModel:
    provider = OpenAIProvider(
        api_key=settings.openai_api_key,
        base_url=settings.openai_base_url,
    )
    return OpenAIModel(
        settings.openai_model,  # The model name is the first positional argument
        provider=provider,
    )
```

Then, update `stream_reply` to pass params (assuming `stream_chat` accepts them—adjust if needed):

```python
async def stream_reply(history: History) -> AsyncIterator[tuple[str, str]]:
    agent = create_agent()
    async for event in agent.stream_chat(
        messages=history.to_model_messages(),
        temperature=0.3,
        max_tokens=4096,
    ):
        if isinstance(event, TextOutput):
            yield "assistant", event.content
        else:
            yield "mcp", str(event)
```

If `stream_chat` doesn't support these args, add them via a custom method or check `pydantic_ai` version/docs for proper integration (e.g., set on the model post-init).

### Why This Works
- `OpenAIModel` init focuses on setup (model name + provider), avoiding the TypeError.
- Moving params to `stream_chat` applies them per-query, which is more flexible and matches how OpenAI's API handles generation settings.
- Restart the CLI; it should now handle "n8n json format" by querying the agent (likely searching for n8n workflow JSON schemas via MCP). If issues persist, verify `pydantic_ai` API compatibility.

### Error Analysis
The `TypeError` occurs because `OpenAIProvider.__init__()` does not accept `temperature` or `max_tokens` as arguments. These are generation parameters typically passed to the model or API calls, not the provider itself (which handles authentication like `api_key` and `base_url`).

### Fix
Update `src/agent.py` by moving `temperature` and `max_tokens` from `OpenAIProvider` to `OpenAIModel`:

```python
def _build_llm() -> OpenAIModel:
    provider = OpenAIProvider(
        api_key=settings.openai_api_key,
        base_url=settings.openai_base_url,
    )
    return OpenAIModel(
        settings.openai_model,  # The model name is the first positional argument
        provider=provider,
        temperature=0.3,
        max_tokens=4096,
    )
```

### Why This Works
- `OpenAIProvider` only needs credentials.
- `OpenAIModel` (from `pydantic_ai`) accepts model-specific params like `temperature` and `max_tokens` for controlling responses.

Restart the CLI after saving. If "n8n json format" is your query, it should now process without crashing—likely fetching n8n workflow JSON structure via the agent.
