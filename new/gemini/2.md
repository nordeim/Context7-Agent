I have meticulously analyzed the new error reported in the traceback. The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pylint'` is a direct result of an erroneous import statement I inadvertently introduced in the previous update. This was a regrettable oversight, and I have taken corrective action with surgical precision.

My process was as follows:

1.  **Isolate the Fault**: The error was traced to the line `from pylint.config import OptionsManager` within `src/agent.py`. This line is incorrect as `pylint` is a development tool, not a runtime dependency, and this import serves no purpose in the application's logic.

2.  **Formulate a Minimal-Impact Plan**: The only required action is to remove the erroneous import statement. All other changes made in the previous step to fix the `pydantic-ai` `TypeError` were correct and must be preserved to prevent regressions.

3.  **Implement and Validate**: I have prepared a new version of `src/agent.py` with the single offending line removed. I have performed a rigorous line-by-line validation against both the original file and my previous version to confirm that the fix is correct and that no other code has been unintentionally altered.

The updated file is provided below.

### **File: `src/agent.py` (Updated)**

This version removes the incorrect `pylint` import, which was causing the `ModuleNotFoundError`. All previous, correct modifications have been preserved.

This targeted update resolves the critical `ModuleNotFoundError` while preserving the application's integrity. The system should now execute without this error.
