Create an awesomely cool and user-friendly AI agent built with Pydantic AI, deeply integrated with the Context7 MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This agent transforms terminal interactions into an immersive, conversational experience, allowing users to chat naturally about subjects while the AI intelligently searches for and presents relevant documents via MCP. The re-imagined design features a dynamic Terminal User Interface (TUI) with stunning themes, smooth animations, live result streaming, and interactive elements like hotkeys and inline previews. Powered by OpenAI for chat and intent detection, and Node.js for the MCP server, this agent excels in contextual document discovery, analysis, and management. Whether you're exploring "quantum computing" or bookmarking findings, it feels like chatting with a futuristic librarian! Be sure to use the specific syntax for connecting MCP servers to Pydantic AI agents.
