This is an exciting and comprehensive project! You need to create a stunning AI agent with Pydantic AI that integrates with Context7 MCP server. Let us break this down systematically:  

1. Project Architecture: I need to create a well-structured project with multiple modules  
2. Core Components: Agent with Pydantic AI, MCP integration, TUI interface, themes, history management  
3. Visual Features: 4 themes (Cyberpunk, Ocean, Forest, Sunset), animations, ASCII art, Rich-based TUI  
4. Functionality: Conversational chat, intent detection, real-time search, document management  
5. Technical Details: Use correct Pydantic AI syntax, OpenAI integration, async operations with anyio  

From the debugging guide provided, I need to be careful about:  

- Using OpenAIModel with model_name parameter  
- Using OpenAIProvider correctly  
- Proper MCP server lifecycle with async context managers  
- Using anyio for async operations  
- Proper message formatting  

Let me implement this step by step, creating a production-ready, visually stunning application.
